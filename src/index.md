Hylia is a lightweight [Eleventy](https://11ty.io) starter kit with [Forestry
CMS](https://forestry.io/) pre-configured, so that you can one-click install a
progressive, accessible blog in minutes. It also gives you a well organised
starting point to extend yourself.

Get started now by [deploying Hylia to Netlify.](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/dirtyf/hylia)

A creative front-end dev who loves building out cool projects together with a team. Based in Gouda, The Netherlands, I work for a local company specialised in Microsoft services and Consulting called ShareValue, where I joined the Front-end team in June off 2018. I really love working on the look and feel part off a site or application.
