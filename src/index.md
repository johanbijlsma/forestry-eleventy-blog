A creative front-end dev who loves building out cool projects together with a team. Based in Gouda, The Netherlands, I work for a local company specialised in Microsoft services and Consulting called ShareValue, where I joined the Front-end team in June off 2018. I really love working on the look and feel part off a site or application.
